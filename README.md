# Cpp-Project - Facebook

 This is the final project for my cpp course in Hahakademit Tel Aviv-Yafo.

Me and Omer Mualem (https://github.com/kom1323) have implemented in cpp an interface of entities data that can be linked together, including members,pages and statuses.
Implemented using object oriented programming.
 
 We used github to update and modify our versions.
