# Cpp-Project - Facebook

 This is the final project for the cpp course in the Acadmic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo.

Me and Omer Mualem (https://github.com/kom1323) have implemented in cpp an interface of entities data that can be linked together, including members, pages and statuses.
Implemented using object oriented programming.
